You are to write a program to find whether the given line segment intersects a given rectangle.

Input

The input consists of n test cases. The first line of the input file contains the number n. Each following line contains one test case of the format: xstart ystart xend yend xleft ytop xright ybottom where (xstart, ystart) is the start and (xend, yend) the end point of the line and (xleft, ytop) the top left and (xright, ybottom) the bottom right corner of the rectangle. The eight numbers are separated by a blank. The terms top left and bottom right do not imply any ordering of coordinates.
Output

For each test case in the input file, the output file should contain a line consisting either of the letter "T" if the line segment intersects the rectangle or the letter "F" if the line segment does not intersect the rectangle.
