An Easy Catch!

(This could be the easiest question ever seen in CodeCracker.)
You are required to write a program which is able to perform the following mathematical operations between two complex numbers:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication

Input:
The first line of the input will contain the number of test cases. Each input test case comprises of three fields.
The first is a symbol, +, - or *. The second and third fields will contain the first and second complex numbers respectively.
Operands will be provided in the form of x+iy, where x and y are real and imaginary integer values respectively.

UPDATED
"x+iy" must be accpeted as a string.

Output:
The output too, must be strictly in the form of x+iy. The number of lines in the output should be the number of input test cases, obvious that is.

Sample Case:

Input:-
2
+
1+i2
3-i4
*
-2-i4
3+i7

Output:-
4-i2
22-i26
